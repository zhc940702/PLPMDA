# PLPMDA
We propose a method to predict microbe-drug associations based on the multi-type similarities and the Pre-completion-based Label Propagation (PLP) algorithm. The code of PLPMDA in this package is implemented in python3.7.

# Description
"PLPMDA_main.py" demonstrates the experimental result on DrugVirus dataset by PLPMDA algorithm.
"PLPMDA.py" is the function of PLPMDA algorithm.
